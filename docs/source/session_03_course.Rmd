## Functions

### Functions that work with vectors

So far we've primarily seen vectors that operate on single values or that take single-valued arguments.

But as we've seen, R is a _vectorized language_.

Try using the following functions on the variables we created in `example_single_patient.R` in [Session 2](session_02.html#work_with_your_project).

```{r}
age_at_visit <- 54:58
tumor_size <- c(9.5, 9.5, 9.7, 9.9, 10.1)
site_code <- c("C220", "C400", "C412", "C220", "C400")
```

```{r}
min(tumor_size)
max(tumor_size)
mean(tumor_size)
median(tumor_size)
var(tumor_size)
sd(tumor_size)
IQR(tumor_size)
```

Those functions all come from base R (standard R library).

The following functions are given to us from `dplyr`.
We have dplyr loaded if we've run `library(tidyverse)`, but I'll include the `dplyr::` first as a reminder that that's where these functions come from.

```{r}
dplyr::first(site_code)
dplyr::last(age_at_visit)
dplyr::nth(site_code, 2)
dplyr::n_distinct(site_code)
```

All of these functions return a single value.
Try the following.
What happens and why?

```{r}
tumor_size * 10

age_at_visit - age_at_diagnosis

paste("Site Code:", site_code)
```

Because R is vectorized, operations are applied to the whole vector.

### Dot, dot, dot

R has a somewhat unique addition for writing and using functions: the dot-dot-dot (`...`).

The `...` is used in two ways:

1. To allow you to include an unknown number of values.

   ```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
   cat("\n   ```", paste("paste <-", capture.output(print(paste))[1]), "```", sep = "\n   ")
   ```

   ```{r}
   paste("a", "b", "c")
   paste("a", "b", "c", "d")
   ```

2. To allow you to pass arguments to an underlying function.

   ```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
   cat("\n   ```", paste("rep <-", capture.output(print(rep))[1]), "```", sep = "\n   ")
   ```

   ```{r}
   rep(1L, 4)
   rep(1L, times = 4)
   rep.int(1L, times = 4)
   ```

## dplyr Basics

[dplyr]{.pkg} provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation and transformation.
In this session, we're going to cover 5 key dplyr functions:

| Function | Action |
|:--------:|-------:|
| `filter()` | Pick out observations by their values |
| `arrange()` | Reorder the rows |
| `select()` | Pick out variables by their names |
| `mutate()` | Create new variables using existing variables |
| `summarize()` | Collapse many values into a single summary |

All [dplyr]{.pkg} verbs work similarly:

1. The first argument is a data frame.

1. Subsequent arguments describe how the verb will transform the data frame, using column names without `"column_name"`

1. The output is a new data frame.

### `filter()`

![](images/dplyr-filter.png)

```{r}
filter(example, site_code == "C400")
filter(example, tumor_size > 9.5)
filter(example, age_visit < max(age_dx))
```

Multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with `&`:

```{r}
filter(example, site_code == "C400", tumor_size > 9.5)
filter(example, site_code == "C400" & tumor_size > 9.5)
```

To build more complex filter combinations, use

::: {.img-center}
| Operation | Symbol | 
|---|---|
| **and** | `&` |
| **or** | `|` |
| **not** | `!` |
:::

<!--
This diagram illustrates the complete set of 

![Boolean Operations from [r4ds](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#logical-operators).](images/r4ds_diagrams_transform-logical.png)
-->

#### Filtering for an item in a group

```{r error=TRUE}
filter(example, site_code == "C412" | "C220") # doesn't work
filter(example, site_code == "C412" | site_code == "C220")
filter(example, site_code %in% c("C412", "C220"))
```

#### Missing values

Filtering can be tricky when there are missing values -- `NA`.
Or sometimes, you're _trying to find_ the missing values.

It's important to keep in mind that `NA`s are "contagious" in R, meaning that the result of almost any operation involving an `NA` will be an `NA`.

```{r error=TRUE}
NA > 42
1 == NA
NA + 2
NA / 3
NA == NA
```

Here's an example that helps to illustrate why `NA == NA` isn't `TRUE`.

```{r results="show"}
# Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
x <- NA

# Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
y <- NA

# Are John and Mary the same age?
x == y
```

`filter()` keeps only the rows where the condition is `TRUE` and drops the rows where it is `FALSE` or `NA`.

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

### `arrange()`

::: {.img-center}
![](images/dplyr-arrange.png){.img-mw500}
:::

To arrange, or sort, the rows according to values in a given column, use `arrange()`.

```{r}
arrange(example, site_code)
arrange(example, desc(site_code))
arrange(example, site_code, tumor_size)
arrange(example, desc(tumor_size), site_code)
```

### `select()`

```{r}
select(example, age_dx, tumor_size)
select(example, age_dx:tumor_size)
select(example, -(patient_id:age_visit))
```

#### Helper functions for `select()`

```{r}
select(example, starts_with("age"))
select(example, ends_with("id"))
select(example, contains("code"))
```

#### Renaming

```{r}
select(example, code = site_code)
rename(example, code = site_code)
```

### `mutate()`

![](images/dplyr-mutate.png)

![](images/dplyr-window-function.png)

```{r}
mutate(example, follow_up = age_visit - age_dx)
mutate(example, elapsed = age_visit - min(age_visit))
mutate(example, 
       tumor_size = tumor_size * 10, 
       tumor_size_mm = tumor_size *100)
```

### `summarize()`

![](images/dplyr-summarize.png)

![](images/dplyr-summary-function.png)


```{r}
summarize(example, min(age_dx))
summarize(example, max_tumor_size = max(tumor_size))
summarize(example, tumor_size_median = median(tumor_size),tumor_size_mean = mean(tumor_size), age_visit = max(age_visit))
```

### `group_by()` + `summarize()`

![](images/dplyr-group_by.png)

```{r error=TRUE}
example_grp <- group_by(example, site_code)
summarize(example_grp, 
  tumor_size_mean = mean(tumor_size), 
  age_mean = mean(age_dx))

example_grp <- group_by(example, site_code, patient_id)
summarize(example_grp, 
  tumor_size_mean = mean(tumor_size), 
  age_mean = mean(age_dx))
```


### `group_by()` + `count()`

```{r}
count(example, site_code)
count(example, patient_id)

# Groups: site_code, patient_id
count(example_grp)
```

### The "pipe" operator `%>%`

It looks like this:

<div style="font-size: 5em; width: 100%; text-align: center;"><code>%>%</code></div>

You can type it with

::: {.img-center}
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>  (Windows)

<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>  (Mac)
:::

You say it like

<div style="font-size: 3em; width: 100%; text-align: center;">...and then...</div>

::: {.bs-callout .alert-info}
Requires [tidyverse]{.pkg} or [dplyr]{.pkg}!
:::

```{r}
ex <- group_by(example, site_code, patient_id)
ex <- mutate(ex, tumor_size = tumor_size * 10)
ex <- summarize(ex, 
  tumor_size_mean = mean(tumor_size), 
  age_mean = mean(age_dx))
ex

example %>% 
  group_by(site_code, patient_id) %>% 
  mutate(tumor_size = tumor_size * 10) %>% 
  summarize(
    tumor_size_mean = mean(tumor_size),
    age_mean = mean(age_dx)
  )
```

## Functions

### Functions that work with vectors

So far we've primarily seen vectors that operate on single values or that take single-valued arguments.

But as we've seen, R is a _vectorized language_.

Try using the following functions on the variables we created in `example_single_patient.R` in [Session 2](session_02.html#work_with_your_project).

```{r}
age_at_visit <- 54:58
tumor_size <- c(9.5, 9.5, 9.7, 9.9, 10.1)
site_code <- c("C220", "C400", "C412", "C220", "C400")
```

```{r}
min(tumor_size)
max(tumor_size)
mean(tumor_size)
median(tumor_size)
var(tumor_size)
sd(tumor_size)
IQR(tumor_size)
```

Those functions all come from base R (standard R library).

The following functions are given to us from `dplyr`.
We have dplyr loaded if we've run `library(tidyverse)`, but I'll include the `dplyr::` first as a reminder that that's where these functions come from.

```{r}
dplyr::first(site_code)
dplyr::last(age_at_visit)
dplyr::nth(site_code, 2)
dplyr::n_distinct(site_code)
```

All of these functions return a single value.
Try the following.
What happens and why?

```{r}
tumor_size * 10

age_at_visit - age_at_diagnosis

paste("Site Code:", site_code)
```

Because R is vectorized, operations are applied to the whole vector.

### Dot, dot, dot

R has a somewhat unique addition for writing and using functions: the dot-dot-dot (`...`).

The `...` is used in two ways:

1. To allow you to include an unknown number of values.

   ```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
   cat("\n   ```", paste("paste <-", capture.output(print(paste))[1]), "```", sep = "\n   ")
   ```

   ```{r}
   paste("a", "b", "c")
   paste("a", "b", "c", "d")
   ```

2. To allow you to pass arguments to an underlying function.

   ```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
   cat("\n   ```", paste("rep <-", capture.output(print(rep))[1]), "```", sep = "\n   ")
   ```

   ```{r}
   rep(1L, 4)
   rep(1L, times = 4)
   rep.int(1L, times = 4)
   ```

## dplyr Basics

[dplyr]{.pkg} provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation and transformation.
In this session, we're going to cover 5 key dplyr functions:

| Function | Action |
|:--------:|-------:|
| `filter()` | Pick out observations by their values |
| `arrange()` | Reorder the rows |
| `select()` | Pick out variables by their names |
| `mutate()` | Create new variables using existing variables |
| `summarize()` | Collapse many values into a single summary |

All [dplyr]{.pkg} verbs work similarly:

1. The first argument is a data frame.

1. Subsequent arguments describe how the verb will transform the data frame, using column names without `"column_name"`

1. The output is a new data frame.

### `filter()`

![](images/dplyr-filter.png)

```{r}
filter(example, site_code == "C400")
filter(example, tumor_size > 9.5)
filter(example, age_visit < max(age_dx))
```

Multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with `&`:

```{r}
filter(example, site_code == "C400", tumor_size > 9.5)
filter(example, site_code == "C400" & tumor_size > 9.5)
```

To build more complex filter combinations, use

::: {.img-center}
| Operation | Symbol | 
|---|---|
| **and** | `&` |
| **or** | `|` |
| **not** | `!` |
:::

<!--
This diagram illustrates the complete set of 

![Boolean Operations from [r4ds](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html#logical-operators).](images/r4ds_diagrams_transform-logical.png)
-->

#### Filtering for an item in a group

```{r error=TRUE}
filter(example, site_code == "C412" | "C220") # doesn't work
filter(example, site_code == "C412" | site_code == "C220")
filter(example, site_code %in% c("C412", "C220"))
```

#### Missing values

Filtering can be tricky when there are missing values -- `NA`.
Or sometimes, you're _trying to find_ the missing values.

It's important to keep in mind that `NA`s are "contagious" in R, meaning that the result of almost any operation involving an `NA` will be an `NA`.

```{r error=TRUE}
NA > 42
1 == NA
NA + 2
NA / 3
NA == NA
```

Here's an example that helps to illustrate why `NA == NA` isn't `TRUE`.

```{r results="show"}
# Let x be Mary's age. We don't know how old she is.
x <- NA

# Let y be John's age. We don't know how old he is.
y <- NA

# Are John and Mary the same age?
x == y
```

`filter()` keeps only the rows where the condition is `TRUE` and drops the rows where it is `FALSE` or `NA`.

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(1, NA, 3))
filter(df, x > 1)
filter(df, is.na(x) | x > 1)
```

### `arrange()`

::: {.img-center}
![](images/dplyr-arrange.png){.img-mw500}
:::

To arrange, or sort, the rows according to values in a given column, use `arrange()`.

```{r}
arrange(example, site_code)
arrange(example, desc(site_code))
arrange(example, site_code, tumor_size)
arrange(example, desc(tumor_size), site_code)
```

### `select()`

```{r}
select(example, age_dx, tumor_size)
select(example, age_dx:tumor_size)
select(example, -(patient_id:age_visit))
```

#### Helper functions for `select()`

```{r}
select(example, starts_with("age"))
select(example, ends_with("id"))
select(example, contains("code"))
```

#### Renaming

```{r}
select(example, code = site_code)
rename(example, code = site_code)
```

### `mutate()`

![](images/dplyr-mutate.png)

![](images/dplyr-window-function.png)

```{r}
mutate(example, follow_up = age_visit - age_dx)
mutate(example, elapsed = age_visit - min(age_visit))
mutate(example, 
       tumor_size = tumor_size * 10, 
       tumor_size_mm = tumor_size *100)
```

#### Recoding or conditionally changing values

Often you'll want to replace certain values of a variable with another value.
There are several helpful functions provided by [dplyr]{.pkg} that let you do this, including:

1. `recode()`: Replace character values with `"old" = "new"`.

    ```r
    var = recode(var, "old" = "new", "OLD" = "new")
    ```

1. `if_else()`: Use logical statements to change the value.

    ```r
    var = if_else(CONDITION, VALUE_IF_TRUE, VALUE_IF_FALSE)
    ```

```{r}
mutate(example, site_code = recode(site_code, "C412" = "C999"))
mutate(example, tumor_size = if_else(site_code == "C400", tumor_size * 100, tumor_size))
```

### `summarize()`

![](images/dplyr-summarize.png)

![](images/dplyr-summary-function.png)


```{r}
summarize(example, min(age_dx))
summarize(example, max_tumor_size = max(tumor_size))
summarize(example, tumor_size_median = median(tumor_size),tumor_size_mean = mean(tumor_size), age_visit = max(age_visit))
```

### `group_by()` & `summarize()`

![](images/dplyr-group_by.png)

```{r error=TRUE}
example_grp <- group_by(example, site_code)
summarize(example_grp, 
  tumor_size_mean = mean(tumor_size), 
  age_mean = mean(age_dx))

example_grp <- group_by(example, site_code, patient_id)
summarize(example_grp, 
  tumor_size_mean = mean(tumor_size), 
  age_mean = mean(age_dx))
```


### `group_by()` & `count()`

```{r}
count(example, site_code)
count(example, patient_id)

# Groups: site_code, patient_id
count(example_grp)
```

## Combining dplyr Verbs

Let's say we want to calculate the **average age** and **tumor size** (in cm) by **site code** for each **patient**.

To do this we'll take our `example` data and

1. Group by `site_code` and `patient_id`

1. Convert tumor size from *cm* to *mm*

1. Summarize `tumor_size` and `age_dx` by their average.

In [dplyr]{.pkg} speak:

```{r}
ex1 <- group_by(example, site_code, patient_id)
ex2 <- mutate(ex1, tumor_size = tumor_size * 10)
ex3 <- summarize(ex2, 
  tumor_size_mean = mean(tumor_size), 
  age_mean = mean(age_dx))
ex3
```

Notice that the output from each step is the input to the next step.
Also, we don't really need `ex1` or `ex2`, we just want the output which we've saved as `ex3`.

To make this much cleaner we can use the pipe operator. 

```{r}
example %>% 
  group_by(site_code, patient_id) %>% 
  mutate(tumor_size = tumor_size * 10) %>% 
  summarize(
    tumor_size_mean = mean(tumor_size),
    age_mean = mean(age_dx)
  )
```

The pipe operator looks like this

<div style="font-size: 5em; width: 100%; text-align: center;"><code>%>%</code></div>

You can type it with

::: {.img-center}
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>  (Windows)

<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>  (Mac)
:::

You say it like

<div style="font-size: 3em; width: 100%; text-align: center;">...and then...</div>

Re-read the code above:

1. Take `example` **and then...**

1. Group by  **and then...**

1. Mutate  **and then...**

1. Summarize

::: {.bs-callout .bs-callout-warning}
The pipe operator is now ubiquitous in modern R code, but it's not part of the R language.

Make sure that you load [tidyverse]{.pkg} or [dplyr]{.pkg} first!
:::

#### Your turn!

Use the pipe operator and [dplyr]{.pkg} verbs to complete the following task:

1. Use the `example` dataset

1. Filter out tumors smaller than **9.7**

1. Calculate `follow_up` time as the number of years between diagnosis and the patient's visit

1. Rename the `site_code` column to `code`.

## Importing Data

### Gather your "exported" data

Download the data from the [Session 3 Materials page][s3-materials].

In the [Files]{.rstudio-tab} pane of your RStudio project, click [More]{.menu-item} &rtrif; [Show Folder in New Window...]{.menu-item} to open the folder in a file browser. 
Copy or move the data files from your downloads folder into your project folder.
Check that you see the files in RStudio.

::: {.muted}
If you're running RStudio in your browser (e.g. on [rstudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud)), you can run the `download.file()` commands in the [materials page][s3-materials].
:::

### Import Using RStudio

There are two main packages for reading in data: [readr]{.pkg} for CSV and [readxl]{.pkg} for Excel.

If you have the option in your data source, choose to export your data as a CSV file.
The options and control for importing into R using [readr]{.pkg} are more powerful and more easily customized.

### Import Excel File

![](images/rstudio-11-import-dataset-excel.png)

<details><summary>Import Code</summary>

```r
library(readxl)
cr_patients <- read_excel("CancerRegistryDataPatients.xlsx",
                          col_types = c("numeric", "numeric", "text",
                                        "text", "text", "text", "date", "text"))
```
</details>

### Import CSV File

![](images/rstudio-12-import-dataset-csv.png)

<details><summary>Import Code</summary>

```r
library(readr)
cr_patients <- read_csv("CancerRegistryDataPatients.csv", 
    col_types = cols(`Date Last Patient Contact/Dead` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y")))
```
</details>

### A Note About Dates

Here is a small reference for date/time formats.
See `?strftime` for more time format placeholders.

```{r results='asis'}
formats <- c("%m/%d/%y", "%m/%d/%Y", "%Y-%m-%d", "%m/%d/%y %H:%M", "%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S", "%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S %p")

purrr::walk(formats, ~ cat("\n - `", .x, "`: ", strftime(Sys.time(), .x), "\n", sep = ""))
```

## Explore the Data!

```{r include=FALSE}
cr_patients <- readr::read_csv(here::here("materials/03/CancerRegistryDataPatients.csv"), 
    col_types = cols(`Date Last Patient Contact/Dead` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y")))
```

Use RStudio to look through the dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
skimr::skim(cr_patients) %>% skimr::kable()
```

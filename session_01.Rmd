## Introduction

See [slides] for the course introduction covering some background on R, why programming can be more effective than point-and-click GUI software, and our expectations for the course.

## Sources for this session

The material for this session is drawn from the following sources.
We'll walk through a version of these introductions together.
When we're done it may seem like we don't know much, but we can already do some [basic data processing](#lets-process-some-data)

## Let's Process Some Data

This example builds on an excerpt of the [Gapminder] data, and contains the following columns.

```{r echo=FALSE}
tibble::tribble(
    ~variable, ~meaning,
    "country",       "Country",
    "continent",       "Continent",
    "year",       "Year",
    "life_expectancy",       "Life Expectancy at Birth",
    "population",       "Total Population",
    "gdp_per_capita",       "Per-Capita GDP"
) %>% 
  mutate(variable = paste0("`", variable, "`")) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


### Importing the data

Download the data from [materials].

```{r}
gapminder <- read_csv("materials/01/gapminder.csv")
```


### Viewing the data

```{r}
gapminder
```


### Using dplyr

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  count()
```

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count()
```

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)
```

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarize(population = sum(population))
```

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarize(mean_life_exp = mean(life_expectancy))
```

### Exporting Data

```r
life_expectancy_summarized <- gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent, year) %>% 
  summarize(mean_life_exp = mean(life_expectancy))
  
write_csv(life_expectancy_summarized,
          "life_expectancy_summarized.csv")
```

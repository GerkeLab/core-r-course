## Packages

### Installing Packages

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("readxl")
```

![](images/install-readxl-rstudio-2.png)

Most packages are hosted on [CRAN] [(cran.rstudio.com)]{.muted}.

How do you find packages?
Besides Google, you can use [MetaCRAN] [(r-pkg.org)]{.muted} to search for available packages.
Or you can use the [CRAN Task View][cran-task-view].

### Attaching (Loading) Packages

```r
library(tidyverse)
```

![](images/console-library-tidyverse.png)

```{r echo=FALSE}
tidyverse_pkgs <-
tidyverse_packages(include_self = FALSE) %>%
  str_replace("\n.+", "") %>%
  paste0("`", ., "`") %>%
  knitr::combine_words()
```

Includes the following packages: `r tidyverse_pkgs`.

```r
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr, tibble) #<< Doesn't do what you think
```

### Using RStudio

You can also use the [Packages]{.rstudio-tab} pane to install and update,

:::

or [Tools]{.menu-item} &rtrif; [Install Packages...]{.menu-item}.

### Behind the Scenes

A package contains:

1. Functions
1. Documentation
1. *Vignettes*
1. *Data*

```r
library(babynames)

install.packages("babynames")
```

```{r error=TRUE}
babynames

babynames::babynames

library(babynames)
babynames
births

ls("package:babynames")

detach("package:babynames", unload = TRUE)
```

## Collections

### Vectors

```{r}
1:3

c(1, 2, 3)

identical(1:3, c(1, 2, 3))

identical(1:3, c(1L, 2L, 3L))

c(1L, 2L, 3L, pi)

fruits <- c("apple", "banana")
fruits

fruits <- c(fruits, "cherimoya")
```

![[A cherimoya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherimoya)](images/cherimoya.jpg)

```{r echo_if_show_results=TRUE}
fruits
```

```{r}
month_days <- c("March" = 31, "April" = 30, May = 31)

month_days

names(month_days) <- c("August", "September", "October")
month_days

month_days["October"]
```

### Lists

```{r}
x <- list(
  fruits = fruits,
  months = names(month_days),
  month_days = month_days
)

x
```

### Data Frames and Tibbles

```{r}
y <- data.frame(
  fruits = fruits,
  months = names(month_days),
  month_days = month_days
)
y

y2 <- data.frame(
  fruits = fruits,
  months = names(month_days),
  month_days = month_days,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  row.names = NULL
)
y2

z <- data_frame(             #<< tibble()
  fruits = fruits,
  months = names(month_days),
  mont_days = month_days
)
z
```

## Data Types Continued

### Review

| Type | Example |
|:----:|:--------|
| integer | `1L` |
| double | `3.14`, `1.23e-4` |
| character | `"apple"` |
| logical | `TRUE`, `FALSE` |
| vector | `c(...)` |
| list | `list(...)` |
| data.frame | `data.frame(...)` |
| tibble | `data_frame(...)` |
| N/A | `NA` |
| null | `NULL` |
| factor | `factor(letters)` |

### Special Data Types

```{r}
c(1, 2, NA, 4)

c(1, 2, NULL, 4)
```

### Factors

We'll talk about this later, but it's basically a vector with an additional **label** and sometimes an **order**.

<details><summary>Sneak Peek</summary>

```{r factor-sneak-peek, results="show"}
factor(1:3)
factor(1:3,
       levels = 1:3)
factor(1:3,
       levels = 1:3,
       labels = c("a", "b", "c"))
factor(1:3,
       levels = 1:3,
       labels = c("a", "b", "c"),
       ordered = TRUE)
factor(1:3,
       levels = 3:1,
       labels = c("a", "b", "c"),
       ordered = TRUE)
```
</details>


### Working with Data Types

#### What is this thing?

```{r}
x <- 1L
y <- pi
z <- "apple"

class(x)
class(y)
class(z)
typeof(z)

class(mtcars)
```


#### Are you this thing?

```{r}
is.integer(1L)
is.numeric(pi)
is.numeric(1L)
is.double(1L)
is.character("one")
is.logical("TRUE")
```

#### Are you even there?

```{r}
is.na(c(1, 2, NA, 4))

is.null(c(1, 2, NULL, 4))

xyz <- NULL
is.null(xyz)
```

#### Turn you into this thing.

```{r}
as.character(1)
as.integer(pi)
as.double(10L)
as.logical(2)
```


## Workspaces & RStudio Projects

### Working Directory

The working directory is where R looks when it tries to find a file or where it writes a file.

You can check where your R process is "living" -- i.e. your working directory -- with

```r
getwd()
```

and you can set it with

```r
setwd("~/myCoolProject")
```

But **this is not recommended**!

You can also use [More]{.menu-item} &rtrif; [Set As Working Directory]{.menu-item} or [Go To Working Directory]{.menu-item} in the [Files]{.rstudio-tab} pane to set the working directory, but this is **also not recommended**.

[When should you? When you get lost.]{.muted}

### Using RStudio Projects

Without some kind of organization scheme, you'll very quickly end up writing all of your R scripts in a single folder.
Multiple analysis will write out files, exporting data and creating plots, each of these writing into the same folder.

![Life without RStudio Projects](images/messy-desktop.png)

Instead, RStudio offers an excellent method of organization called **Projects**.
Using RStudio projects, each analysis is self-contained and organized, each in its own way, and it's easy to switch from one project to another and know that your files will be organized, your environment will be clean, and you can pick everything back up from where you started.

![Life _with_ RStudio Projects, [credit](https://www.citi.io/2016/04/06/if-you-think-you-are-obsessively-organized-think-again-with-these/)](images/obsessively-organized.jpg)

### Create an RStudio Project

Select [File]{.menu-item} &rtrif; [New Project]{.menu-item} or choose [New Project]{.menu-item} from the drop-down menu in the upper right corner of the RStudio window.

::: {.img-center}
![](images/rstudio-project-01-new.png){.img-mw500}
:::

Select **New Directory** to create your project in a new directory.
If you already have files in a directory that you want to use, choose _Existing Directory_.

::: {.img-center}
![](images/rstudio-project-02-create-project.png){.img-mw500}
:::

Select the type of project you want to start -- this will generally be **New Project**.

::: {.img-center}
![](images/rstudio-project-03-project-type.png){.img-mw500}
:::

Choose the name for the folder that will be created to house your project and pick the folder where the project folder will be created.

Here we give the new project folder the name **`cds-r-course`**.
This will also be the name of the project itself.

::: {.img-center}
![](images/rstudio-project-04-create-new-project.png){.img-mw500}
:::

Your project will be created and you'll be dropped into a new R/RStudio session.

![](images/rstudio-project-05-blank-project.png)

### Work with your project

Use the [Files]{.rstudio-tab} to create a folder called `data` in your project folder.

Run the following command to download the `gapminder.csv` file into your `data` folder.

```r
> download.file("https://gerkelab.github.io/core-r-course/materials/01/gapminder.csv", "data/gapminder.csv")
```

Create a new R script.
Add the following code to it.

```{r example-single-patient-file, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

patient_id <- 5554321
age_at_diagnosis <- 54
age_at_visit <- 54:58
tumor_size <- c(9.5, 9.5, 9.7, 9.9, 10.1)
site_code <- c("C220", "C400", "C412", "C220", "C400")
```

```{r ref.label="example-single-patient-file", results="hide", echo=FALSE, eval=-1}
```

Save the file as `example_single_patient.R` in your project directory.

Source the file.

Close the project.
Take a deep breath.
Re-open the project.
Everything is still there!

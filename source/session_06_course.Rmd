## Tidying Data

### The three rules of tidy data

1. Columns represent separate variables

2. Rows represent individual observations

3. Observational units form tables

### Why tidy data? {.tabset .tabset-pills}

```r
source("https://git.io/fATEK")
```

Each of the following tables contains the same five variables: `mrn`, `sequence`, `age`, `tumor_size`, `tumor_unit`.

How easy would it be to calculate **average tumor size** for each patient?
What problems would you face if your data were formatted like the examples below?

```{r echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
table_6a <- tibble::tribble(
  ~mrn, ~sequence, ~age, ~tumor_size, ~tumor_unit,
  289034L,        1L,  47L,         0.9,        "cm",
  289034L,        2L,  47L,         999,        "mm",
  290660L,        1L,  49L,          30,        "mm",
  290660L,        2L,  49L,         999,        "mm",
  341050L,        1L,  61L,         999,        "mm",
  341050L,        2L,  70L,         2.1,        "cm",
  385615L,        1L,  71L,          12,        "mm",
  385615L,        2L,  71L,           2,        "cm",
  550955L,        1L,  43L,         2.5,        "cm",
  550955L,        2L,  43L,         998,        "mm"
)

table_6b <-
  table_6a %>% 
    mutate(tumor_size = paste(tumor_size, tumor_unit)) %>% 
    select(-tumor_unit) %>% 
    gather(type, value, age:tumor_size) %>% 
    arrange(mrn, sequence)

table_6c <-
  table_6a %>% 
    mutate(age = paste0(age, " (", sequence, ")")) %>% 
    select(-sequence)

table_6d1 <- 
  table_6a %>% 
  select(mrn, sequence, age) %>% 
  spread(sequence, age)

table_6d2 <-
  table_6a %>% 
  mutate(tumor_size = paste(tumor_size, tumor_unit)) %>% 
  select(mrn, sequence, tumor_size) %>% 
  spread(sequence, tumor_size)

table_6e <- 
  t(table_6a) %>%
  as.data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  rownames_to_column("var") %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate_all(str_trim) %>% 
  {
    colnames(.) <- paste(c("var", .[1, -1]))
    .[-1, ]
  }
```

#### Example 1

```{r results="show"}
table_6b
```

#### Example 2

```{r results="show"}
table_6c
```

#### Example 3

```{r results="show"}
table_6d1 # age
table_6d2 # tumor_size
```

#### Example 4

```{r results="show"}
table_6e
```


### Tidying Data {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Most data isn't tidy: often data is organized for something other than *analysis*.
For example, the data may be structured in a way that's easiest for data entry or so that all of the data fits on a single page.

First, ask yourself (or the person who created the data):

1. What are the variables?

1. What are the observations?

Sometimes, a _variable_ is spread across multiple columns.
Othertimes, an _observation_ is scattered across multiple rows.

The [tidyr]{.pkg} packages is part of the [tidyverse]{.pkg} and loaded with `library(tidyverse)`.

#### `gather()`

```r
gather(data, key, value, ...)
```

Use `gather()` to _gather_ the values of a variable that are spread across columns.

The `key` is the name of the variable that will hold the values that are currently used as column names.
The `value` is the name of the variables that holds the values in those columns.

```{r}
table_6d1
gather(table_6d1, sequence, age, `1`, `2`)
```

#### `spread()`

```r
spread(data, key, value)
```

`spread()` is the inverse of `gather()`.
The values of the variable given as `key` will be the new column names that will contain the values in `value`.

```{r}
table_6b
spread(table_6b, type, value)
```

### Quick Review

Which function would you use to transform this data into tidy format?

[Pew Forum on Religious and Public Life](session_05_table.html)

## Working with Dates

To work with dates, we need another packges from the [tidyverse]{.pkg} called [lubridate]{.pkg}.
This package isn't loaded by default, so you'll need to run

```{r}
library(lubridate)
```

### About dates, times and date-times

```
2006-01-02 03:04:05
```

A **date-time** is a point in time, stored as the number of seconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`.
Note that a date-time also understands time zones.

```{r}
as_datetime(1136171045)
```

A **date** is a _day_ and is stored as the number of days since `1970-01-01`.

```{r}
as_date(13150)
```

An [hms]{.pkg} **time** is stored as the number of seconds since `00:00:00`.

```{r}
hms::as.hms(3 * 60^2 + 4 * 60 + 5)
```

### Converting strings to date-times

[lubridate]{.pkg} has a number of functions that convert strings to date-times.
The functions are named so that they match the order of the date components in the string.
The the string doesn't include _time_, a _date_ is returned rather than a _date-time_.

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
data_frame(
  element = c("year", "month", "day", "hour", "minute", "second"),
  letter = paste0("**", c("y", "m", "d", "h", "m", "s"), "**")
) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
ymd_hms("2006-01-02 03:04:05")
ymd_hm("2006-01-02 03:04")
ymd("2006-01-02")

mdy_hm("1/2/06 3:04")
mdy_hm("January 2, 2006 3:04")
mdy("1/2/2006")

dmy_hm("2 Jan 2006 3:04")
dmy("2 Jan 2006")
```

### Getting and Setting Date Components

You can get or set a date component with the singular noun describing the date element.

```{r}
x <- ymd_hms("2006-01-02 03:04:05")

date(x)

year(x)
week(x)

epiyear(x)
epiweek(x)

month(x)

day(x)
wday(x)
wday(x, label = TRUE)
wday(x, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)

hour(x)
minute(x)
second(x)
```

For all of the above you can also use this syntax to change the value.

```{r, results='show'}
y <- ymd_hms("2006-01-02 03:04:05")
day(y) <- 7
y
```

### Moving the date-time

If you want to adjust a date-time on the timeline, you can add or subtract time periods, like 2 years.
These functions are all named after the plural nouns.

```{r}
x <- ymd_hms("2006-01-02 03:04:05")

x + years(4)
x + months(4)
x - days(4)
x - hours(1)
x + minutes(20)
```

### Durations and Comparing date-times

```{r error=TRUE}
x <- ymd_hms("2006-01-02 03:04:05")
y <- ymd_hms("2007-02-03 04:05:06")

x > y
x < y

y - x
x + y #<< Error in `+.POSIXt`(x, y) `+` not defined...

# Comparing date-time
z <- y - x
z
as.integer(z)

# Compareing dates
z <- as_date(y) - as_date(x)
z
as.integer(z)
```

### Rounding Dates

```{r}
x <- ymd_hms("2006-01-02 03:04:05")
y <- ymd_hms("2007-02-03 04:05:06")

# Round to nearest unit
round_date(x, unit = "minute")
round_date(y, unit = "month")

# Round down to nearest unit
floor_date(x, unit = "hour")
floor_date(x, unit = "day")

# Round up to nearest unit
ceiling_date(y, unit = "hour")
ceiling_date(y, unit = "day")

# Rollback to last day of previous month
rollback(x)
rollback(x, roll_to_first = TRUE)
rollback(x, roll_to_first = TRUE, preserve_hms = FALSE)
```

### Time Zones

```{r}
x <- ymd_hms("2006-01-02 03:04:05")

with_tz(x, tzone = "US/Eastern")

force_tz(x, tzone = "US/Eastern")
```

```{r results="show"}
timezones <- OlsonNames()
timezones[grepl("US", timezones)]
```

### Homework {.tabset}

We'll use the [Breast Cancer Registry Data](session_04_materials.html) from Session 4.
I've started writing the script with some tips and hints, which you can download from the [Session 6 materials page](session_06_materials.html).
Or, if you'd like to start blind, you can use the code in Import Data below to get started.

<details><summary>Import Data</summary>

```r
library(tidyverse)
# If you don't have the data in your working directory, you can download it by
# uncommenting and running the two lines below.
# download.file("https://git.io/fATNV", "CancerRegistryData.csv")
# download.file("https://git.io/fATNo", "CancerRegistryDataPatients.csv")

cr_patients <- read_csv(
  "CancerRegistryDataPatients.csv",
  col_types = cols(`Date Last Patient Contact/Dead` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"))
)

cr <- read_csv(
  "CancerRegistryData.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    `Date Last Patient Contact/Dead` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"),
    `Date of Diagnosis` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y")
  )

#### Task 1

Merge the two data sets to add the patient information to their diagnosis records.

#### Task 2

Find deceased patients at least 75 years or older.
Create a data frame containing their patient information and all of their diagnosis records.

#### Task 3

Find the diagnosis records of the African American patients.

**Bonus:** Find the diagnosis records of _married_ African American patients.

#### Task 4

Find all patients who have had more than one cancer diagnosis and create a data frame with only their patient information.

#### Task 5

Find patients who were last contacted in 2017 and merge their patient information with their diagnosis records. Transform all dates to be the number of days since their earliest diagnosis.

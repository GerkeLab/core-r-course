## Homework Review

Review the homework from [Session 5](session_05_materials.html).

You can check out the approach I took [in this page](materials/04/cancer_registry_dplyr.html).
There is more than one way to accomplish each task, so it's okay if your code looks different!

- What parts of these tasks were difficult?
- Which parts did you find easy?
- What questions did you have as you worked?
- Were you able to find the answers to any of these questions?

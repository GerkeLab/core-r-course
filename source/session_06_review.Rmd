## Review

### dplyr Homework

Review the homework from [Session 5](session_05_materials.html).

You can check out the approach I took [in this page](materials/04/cancer_registry_dplyr.html).
There is more than one way to accomplish each task, so it's okay if your code looks different!

- What parts of these tasks were difficult?
- Which parts did you find easy?
- What questions did you have as you worked?
- Were you able to find the answers to any of these questions?


### Tidy Data

#### The three rules of tidy data

1. Columns represent separate variables

2. Rows represent individual observations

3. Observational units form tables


### Review: Two-Table [dplyr]{.pkg} verbs

#### Keys

What are the two types of keys?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

- A **primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table. For example, `patients$id` is a primary key because it uniquely identifies each patient in the `patients` table.

- A foreign key uniquely identifies an observation in another table. For example, the `encounters$patient_id` is a foreign key because it appears in the `patients` table where it matches each encounter to a unique `patient`.
</details>

#### Exercise

What is/are the primary key(s) in the `babynames` data set?

```{r s6-babynames, eval=FALSE}
babynames::babynames %>% 
  sample_n(10)
```

<details><summary>Output</summary>

```{r ref.label="s6-babynames", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, results="show"}
```

</details>

#### Joins

I highly encourage you to read the chapter on [Relational Data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html) in the R4DS book.

You can also review all of the join animations by visiting my page on [tidy animated verbs](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidy-animated-verbs/#readme).

Mutating Joins

- `inner_join()`
- `left_join()`
- `right_join()`
- `full_join()`

Filtering Joins

- `semi_join()`
- `anti_join()`

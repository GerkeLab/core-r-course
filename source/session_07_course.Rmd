## Package Spotlight: [janitor]{.pkg}

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sfirke/janitor/master/man/figures/logo_small.png){.img-right}][janitor]

> **janitor** has simple functions for examining and cleaning dirty data. It was built with beginning and intermediate R users in mind and is optimized for user-friendliness.

To install [janitor]{.pkg}:

```r
install.packages("janitor")
```

### Clean names, remove empties, find duplicates

Three functions are useful on a daily basis:

1. `clean_names()`: Makes nice, easy to use names

2. `remove_empty()`: Removes rows or columns where _everything_ is missing

3. `get_dupes(df, col1, col2)`: Get rows in `df` that have duplicate values in `col1` and `col2`.

```r
library(janitor)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)

cr <- read_csv("CancerRegistryData.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  remove_empty() %>% 
  mutate(
    date_of_diagnosis = mdy(date_of_diagnosis),
    date_last_patient_contact_dead = mdy(date_last_patient_contact_dead)
  )
```

```{r results="show", echo=FALSE}
cr <- readr::read_csv(
  here::here("materials/04/CancerRegistryData.csv")
) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  janitor::remove_empty(c("rows", "cols")) %>% 
  mutate(
    date_of_diagnosis = lubridate::mdy(date_of_diagnosis),
    date_last_patient_contact_dead = lubridate::mdy(date_last_patient_contact_dead)
  )
```

```{r results='show'}
names(cr)
```

## Doing things with strings

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/master/PNG/stringr.png){.img-right width=300}][stringr]

```r
library(stringr) 

# part of the tidyverse and loaded with
library(tidyverse)
```

### Quick String Review

Which of the following are valid R strings:

1. `"I am OZ, the Great and Terrible"`

1. `"You're a humbug!"`

1. `"There's no place like 'home'"`

1. `"\"Can't you give me brains?,\" asked Scarecrow"`

### Load Packages and Data

[This script](source/session-07_import_data.R) loads the [tidyverse]{.pkg}, [lubridate]{.pkg}, and [janitor]{.pkg} and then loads the example [Cancer Registry Data](session_04_materials.html#individual-files).

```r
source("https://git.io/fAOVu")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
source(here::here("source/session-07_import_data.R"), local = TRUE)
```

### Work Directly with Strings

All of the [stringr]{.pkg} functions start with **`str_`**, like `str_c()`.
This function takes parts of a string and concatenates them, just like `c()` takes parts of a vector and puts them together.

```{r}
str_c("Something", "interesting")
str_c("Something", "interesting", sep = " ")

str_c("Something", c("funny", "odd"), sep = " ")
str_c("Something", c("funny", "odd"), sep = " ", collapse = " or ")
```

#### Detect if a string contains another string

```{r}
str_detect("apple", "ap")
str_detect(c("apple", "grape", "banana"), "ap")
```

<details><summary>Visualize</summary>

```{r echo=FALSE, results="show"}
regexplain::view_regex(c("apple", "grape", "banana"), "ap")
```
</details>

```{r}
cr %>% 
  filter(str_detect(histology_behavior_icd_o_3, "CARCINOMA"))

cr %>% filter(
  str_detect(histology_behavior_icd_o_3, "CARCINOMA"),
  !str_detect(histology_behavior_icd_o_3, "INFILTRATING")
)
```

#### Count the number of times a string is found in other string(s)

```{r}
str_count("apple", "p")
str_count(c("apple", "grape", "banana"), "p")
```

#### Extract part of a string

```{r}
str_extract(c("apple", "grape", "banana"), "p")
```

#### Remove or replace part of a string

```{r}
str_remove(c("apple fruit", "grapefruit", "fruit banana"), "fruit")

str_replace(c("apple fruit", "grapefruit", "fruit banana"), "fruit", "FRUIT")

str_remove("apple fruit and banana fruit", "fruit")
str_remove_all("apple fruit and banana fruit", "fruit")

str_replace_all("apple fruit and banana fruit", "fruit", "FRUIT")
```

#### Convert string to lower, upper or title case

```{r}
str_to_lower("STOP SHOUTING")

str_to_upper("talk loudly")

str_to_title("be a little more professional")
```

### Exercises 7.1 {.tabset}

#### Task 1

Find all `BREAST` cancer diagnosis records with a payer source that includes `HMO`s.

```
</details>

#### Task 2

Count the total number of times surgery appears in the prescribed first course for each diagnosis record.

```r
cr %>% 
  mutate(
    ________ = str_=====(summary_of_rx_1st_course, "SURGERY")
  ) %>% 
  group_by(medical_record_number) %>% 
  summarize(n_surgery = sum(________))
```

    surgery_count = str_count(summary_of_rx_1st_course, "SURGERY")
  ) %>% 
  group_by(medical_record_number) %>% 
  summarize(n_surgery = sum(surgery_count))
```
</details>

#### Task 3

I took another look at the data and improved the previous code.
What improvement did I make to get this result?

```{r session-07-task-3, echo=FALSE, results="show"}
cr %>% 
  mutate(
    surgery_count = str_count(summary_of_rx_1st_course, "SURG")
  ) %>% 
  group_by(medical_record_number) %>% 
  summarize(n_surgery = sum(surgery_count))
```

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

```{r ref.label="session-07-task-3", echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
```
</details>

#### Task 4

The `cr_patients` dataset also includes an `email` field, but some of the records weren't filled out correctly.
An email _definitely_ has to have an `@`.

How many patients are missing a valid email address with this criteria?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

```{r results='asis'}
cr_patients %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(email, "@")) %>% 
  select(email) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Regular Expressions

### What is a regular expression?

Our diagnosis records include an ICD code for the location of the cancer, but these values include additional text:

```{r results="show"}
select(cr, site_primary_icd_o_3)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
icd_example <- cr %>% sample_n(1) %>% pull(site_primary_icd_o_3)
```

How would you describe in words the structure of a breast cancer related IDC code?

Pretend you're writing instructions for a robot that can only look at one letter of input at a time.
How would you instruct the robot to extract just the IDC code `"`r str_extract(icd_example, '\\w\\d+\\b')`"` from the full string `"`r icd_example`"`?

Here are the ICD codes found in this example.

```{r results="show", echo=FALSE}
cr %>% 
  pull(site_primary_icd_o_3) %>% 
  str_extract("\\w\\d+\\b") %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  sort()
```

**Regular expressions** are a language for describing patterns in strings.

### An RStudio Addin to help you

[RStudio Addin - RegExplain](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/regexplain/).

### Basic Regular Expressions

```
"abc123"
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
tibble::tribble(
  ~ RegExp, ~ Meaning, ~ Example, ~ Result
  , "`\\w`", "Word Character (a letter)", "`\\w`", "**a**bc123"
  , "`\\d`", "Digit (a number)", "`\\d\\d`", "abc**12**3"
  , "`.`", "Anything", "`c.`", "ab**c1**123"
  , "`+`", "One or more", "`c.+`", "ab**c123**"
  , "`*`", "Zero or more", "`abc\\d*`", "**abc123**"
  , "`?`", "Maybe?", "`abcd?1`", "**abc1**23"
  , "`|`", "Or", "`abcd|1`", "abc**1**23"
  , "`^`", "Start", "`^a`", "**a**bc123"
  , "`$`", "End", "`3$`", "abc12**3**"
  , "`()`", "Group", "`abc(d|1)`", "**abc1**23"
) %>% 
  knitr::kable(align = "cl")
```


### Backslashes!

As we saw with the examples above, there are characters that have special meaning in strings in R.
For example, a string starts and ends with `"` or `'`.

```{r, results="show"}
writeLines("There is no place like home")
```

If we used `"` to open or close the string but we want to have another `"` _inside the string_, we need to **escape** the quote.

```{r results="show"}
writeLines("There is no place like \"home\"")
```

This is called **escaping** because adding the backslash lets you _escape_ the special semantics of the character.
It indicates that you don't want a _special_ `"`, you want a regular _literal_ `"`.

**What if you want to add a backslash?**
The backslash is also special (it does the escaping), so to write a literal backslash you have to escape the backslash, too.

```{r results="show"}
writeLines("\\")
```

Some of the [regular expressions above](#basic_regular_expressions) include backslashes.
To write this in a string in R, you need to escape the backslash.

```{r results="show", error=TRUE}
str_extract("abc123", "\w")
```

```{r results="show"}
str_extract("abc123", "\\w")
str_extract("abc123", "\\w\\w\\d")
writeLines("\\w\\w\\d")
```

**Escaping for R or for the regular expression**
When writing regular expressions, you're operating at two levels.
First, you are writing a code into R to store the strings.
Second, when R is done processing that code we want the output to be a regular expression.

So above, we write `"\\w"` into R so that we get a regular expression like `"\w"`.

But regular expressions also have special characters, like `.` and `+`.
If we want to write _literal_ versions of these in our regular expressions -- for example to match the dot in `10.123` -- we need to escape the dot _at the regular expression level_.

Adding **one backslash** escapes at the R level:

```{r results="show", error=TRUE}
str_extract("10.123", "0\.1")
```

But this doesn't pass down to the regular expression level.

```{r results="show", error=TRUE}
writeLines("0\.1")
```

To get _there_ we need _yet another_ backslash.

```{r result="show"}
str_extract("10.123", "0\\.1")
writeLines("0\\.1")
```

**How can you write an actual backslash at the regular expression level?**

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

```{r}
writeLines("\\\\")
```

## Regular expressions in data

Back to our example from before.
How can we extract the ICD code from the diagnosis records?

```{r results="show"}
cr %>% 
  select(site_primary_icd_o_3)
```

```r
cr %>% 
  select(site_primary_icd_o_3) %>% 
  mutate(icd = str______(site_primary_icd_o_3, "_____"))
```

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

```{r results="show"}
cr %>% 
  select(site_primary_icd_o_3) %>% 
  mutate(icd = str_extract(site_primary_icd_o_3, "C5\\d\\d"))
```
</details>

How can we extract the ICD meaning?
Note: it's inside `(` and `)`, but these are special characters in regular expressions.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

```{r results="show"}
cr %>% 
  select(site_primary_icd_o_3) %>% 
  mutate(
    icd = str_extract(site_primary_icd_o_3, "C5\\d\\d"),
    icd_info = str_extract(site_primary_icd_o_3, "\\(.+\\)"),
    icd_info = str_remove_all(icd_info, "\\(|\\)")
  )
```
